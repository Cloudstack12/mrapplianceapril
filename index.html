                <h1>5 Reasons Why Your Dishwasher is Leaking from the Bottom</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Dishwashers are a convenient way to wash utensils, cups, and other tableware. If you’re busy or have more plates than you know what to do with, having one saves you time and effort. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, a broken or poorly functioning dishwasher can be a nuisance, especially if it’s causing a water leak. There are a handful of reasons why your machine may be acting up. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you’re unsure why your dishwasher is leaking from the bottom, read on to troubleshoot the problem: <br>

                <h2>Reason 1: Defective Gasket</h2>
                <p>
                    A defective gasket is one of the most common causes of a leaking dishwasher. The gasket runs along the perimeter of the machine’s door to create a watertight seal when the door is shut. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, when the gasket gets damaged, dirty, or loose, it won’t seal correctly. This can result in water escaping from the dishwasher door during rinse cycles. <br>
                    <br>
                    To check the gasket, open the appliance door and look for cracks, holes, or dirt. If it’s damaged or loose, you’ll have to replace it. If there’s just dirt buildup, you can clean it with a cloth. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reason 2: Damaged Water Pump System</h2>
                    You may have a problem with the water pump system if your dishwasher is dripping. It’s in charge of two things: delivering water to the wash cycle and emptying water out of the drain. <br>
                    <br>
                    If your water pump system is damaged, this could cause water at the bottom of your appliance to build up. <br>
                    <br>
                    This system also consists of hoses and clamps on those hoses to carry and drain water from the dishwasher. If these break or wear out, your machine will leak water down the sides and out of the bottom. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reason 3: Faulty Water Inlet Valve</h2>
                    It’s important to check the valve that lets water into the chamber of the dishwasher for any issues. <br>
                    <br>
                    The water inlet valve is found on the water inlet hose in the rear of your dishwasher. If the valve is leaking, it can’t be repaired and must be replaced by a professional service. The leak can become extensive if not addressed. <br>
                    <br>
                    Keep in mind that your dishes will not be properly washed if the valve is faulty. A common sign of failure is if you hear running sounds when the machine is in use. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reason 4: Clogged Filter</h2>
                    Water at the bottom of your dishwasher can be the result of a clogged filter. Filters are meant to catch food particles before they end up in the drain. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, if your filter is too stuffed, water can overfill and leak from the bottom of your appliance. It’s important to clean your filter regularly. Most filters can last up to five years with frequent maintenance. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reason 5: Damaged Float Switch</h2>
                    A dishwasher comes with a float and float switch to maintain proper water levels during wash and rinse cycles. For example, when your machine runs, the float moves with the rising water. <br>
                    <br>
                    When the water reaches a certain level, it prompts the float switch to turn the water off. However, if the switch is damaged, the water level will get too high and cause leaking. <br>

                    <h2>FAQs about Leaky Dishwashers</h2>
                    <b>Why is my dishwasher leaking?</b><br>
                    <br>

                    <b>How do I fix my dishwasher leaking from the bottom?</b><br>

                    What is the most common cause of a dishwasher leaking? <br>
                    <br>
                    A defective gasket is one of the leading causes of a leaking machine. It’s located along the perimeter of your dishwasher’s door to create a watertight seal when the door is closed. You can repair it if there’s dirt buildup. However, if it’s loose or damaged, it may be time for a replacement. <br>
